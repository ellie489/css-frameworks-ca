# css-frameworks-ca
This is my course assignment for CSS Frameworks(Bootstrap).
Included in my project are the 3 following HTML pages:
1. Login Page
2. Profile Page
3. Feed Page

I have installed Node.Js, Bootstrap, SASS and Live server into my project, configured NPM Scripts in package.json,
and finally implemented my design using Bootstrap and SASS overrides.
